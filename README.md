# Project Title

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and data for processing, training, and analyzing text data related to COVID-19 press conferences. The primary goal is to preprocess the data, train models, annotate sentences, and conduct data analysis to understand the policies and measures taken by different countries during the pandemic.

### ðŸ“‚ Scripts

This folder contains four subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific part of the project workflow:

#### ðŸ“‚ 1_Preprocessing

This subdirectory includes scripts for preprocessing the text data, specifically for Quebec and Sweden.

- **`1_Preprocessed_QC.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Preprocesses text data from Quebec by removing English sentences, tokenizing the text, and creating sentence contexts.

- **`1_Preprocessed_SWD.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Similar to the Quebec preprocessing script, but for Swedish text data. It removes English sentences, tokenizes the text, and creates sentence contexts.
  - **Key Functions**: Clean and structure Swedish text data by removing non-relevant sentences and tokenizing for analysis.

- **`2_Sentences_to_annotate.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Calculates the number of sentences that need to be annotated for both Quebec and Sweden.
  - **Key Functions**: Count and determine sample sizes of sentences for annotation based on statistical calculations.

#### ðŸ“‚ 2_Feedback_Scripts

This subdirectory includes scripts to process and prepare data for annotation feedback.

- **`1_JSONL_Annotation.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Converts annotation data to JSONL format for processing.
  - **Key Functions**: Transform annotation data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

- **`2_Supplementary_sent_JSONL_FR.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Processes additional French sentences into JSONL format.
  - **Key Functions**: Prepare supplementary French text data for annotation.

- **`2_Supplementary_sent_JSONL_SWD.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Processes additional Swedish sentences into JSONL format.
  - **Key Functions**: Prepare supplementary Swedish text data for annotation.

- **`2_Translate_JSONL_for_annotation.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Translates sentences to be annotated and formats them into JSONL.
  - **Key Functions**: Translate and format text data for annotation tasks.

- **`3_JSONL_train_AS.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Prepares JSONL files for training annotation models.
  - **Key Functions**: Structure data into JSONL format for training purposes.

#### ðŸ“‚ 3_Training_and_Annotation

This subdirectory contains scripts for training models and annotating text data.

- **`1_Train_SWD.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Trains models using the Swedish text data.
  - **Key Functions**: Train machine learning models on preprocessed Swedish text data.

- **`2_Predict_QC.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Makes predictions using models trained on Quebec data.
  - **Key Functions**: Use trained models to predict annotations on Quebec text data.

- **`2_Predict_SWD.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: Makes predictions using models trained on Swedish data.
  - **Key Functions**: Use trained models to predict annotations on Swedish text data.
